        <br><br>

        <p class="body-p">To run a nation judiciously, the government needs to collect tax from the eligible citizens; paying taxes to the local government is an integral part of everyone’s life, no matter where we live in the world.
        
          <br><br>

        Now, taxes can be collected in any form such as state taxes, central government taxes, direct taxes, indirect taxes, and much more. For your ease, let’s divide the types of taxation in India into two categories, viz. direct taxes and indirect taxes. This segregation is based on how the tax is being paid to the government.</p>

        <h1 class="head1">Why we need to pay the tax</h1>

        <img src="/income-tax-calculator-javascript-main/a1.jpeg" alt="" class="img">

        <br><br>

        <p class="body-p"> Some people raise the question 'Why should I pay tax? They argue: I have to pay for my food, for my house, for my travel, for my medical treatment, for owning a vehicle not only cost of vehicle but also vehicle tax and what not. Even on many roads, one has to pay toll tax! They also say that if we compare with countries like USA and UK, the people get social security as also medical facilities virtually without any cost. But India does not offer such facilities.

          <br><br>

          Here are some reasons why we need to pay tax to the government in India:
          <br><br>

          <b>Infrastructure Development</b>: Taxes are used to construct and maintain roads, highways, bridges, and public transportation systems, connecting cities and towns across the country.
          <br><br>

          <b>Healthcare</b>: The government uses tax revenue to fund public hospitals, healthcare programs, and medical research, ensuring access to quality healthcare for all citizens.
          <br><br>

          <b>Education</b>: Taxes support the development of schools, colleges, and universities, providing education to millions of students and promoting human capital development.
          <br><br>

          <b>Employment Programs</b>: Tax revenue is used to fund employment schemes, such as MGNREGA, which provides job opportunities and income support to rural communities.
          <br><br>

          <b>Subsidies</b>: Taxes help fund subsidies for essential commodities like food, fertilizers, and cooking gas, benefiting low-income households and farmers.
          <br><br>

          <b>Pension Schemes</b>: Tax revenue supports pension schemes for government employees, retirees, and other eligible citizens, ensuring a secure retirement.
          <br><br>

          <b>Civil Operations</b>: Taxes enable the government to perform civil operations, such as law and order maintenance, judicial services, and administrative expenses.
          <br><br>

          <b>Welfare Schemes</b>: Tax revenue funds various welfare schemes, including those for the elderly, disabled, and marginalized communities, promoting social justice and equality.
          <br><br>

          <b>National Defense</b>: A portion of tax revenue is allocated to the defense sector, ensuring the country’s security and protection.
        </p>

        <h1 class="head1">How it is beneficial to our country</h1>
        <p class="body-p">
          
          Direct taxation is one of the main sources of income for the government.
          <br><br>

          It also affects inflation, demand and supply within the economy by regulating disposable incomes across the board.
          <br><br>

          Luxury goods and services are the most affected by this regulation and so, the tax rates have to strike a balance between providing administrative funds, limiting inflation and leaving enough disposable income to encourage consumption.
          <br><br>

          Deductions on certain services such as insurance or some types of loans will attract individuals and organizations to invest in the Indian economy and generate usable capital.
          <br><br>

          This will allow for greater stability in the economy while also providing stakeholders with a greater degree of financial security.
          <br><br>

          More capital flowing into the country will increase revenue and in turn affect tax collection, providing the government with a higher budget for expenditure on developing the nation’s infrastructure, as well as its natural, man made and human resources.</p>

        <h1 class="head1">How is tax calculated</h1>
        <p class="body-p">
          In India, income tax is calculated based on a slab system, where different income ranges are taxed at varying rates. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you understand the tax calculation process:
          <br><br>

          Gross Total Income: Calculate your total income from all sources, including salary, interest, dividends, capital gains, and other income.
          <br><br>

          Deductions: Subtract eligible deductions from your gross total income. These deductions include:
          <br><br>

          Standard deduction (₹50,000 for FY 2024-25)
          <br>

          Investments under sections 80C to 80U (e.g., EPF, PPF, LIC premiums, and more)
          <br>

          Medical expenses under section 80DD
          <br>

          Interest on home loan under section 80EE
          <br><br>

          Other deductions as per the Income-tax Act
          <br><br>

          Taxable Income: After deducting all eligible deductions, calculate your taxable income.
          <br><br>

          Tax Slabs: Apply the applicable tax slab rates to your taxable income. For FY 2024-25, the tax slabs are:
          <br><br>

          0% tax on income up to ₹3,00,000
          <br>

          5% tax on income between ₹3,00,001 and ₹7,00,000
          <br>

          10% tax on income between ₹7,00,001 and ₹10,00,000
          <br>

          15% tax on income between ₹10,00,001 and ₹12,00,000
          <br>

          20% tax on income between ₹12,00,001 and ₹15,00,000
          <br>

          30% tax on income above ₹15,00,000
          <br><br>

          Surcharge and Cess: Apply surcharge (up to 37%) and cess (4%) to the tax amount calculated above.
          <br><br>

          Total Tax Liability: Add the surcharge and cess to the tax amount to arrive at your total tax liability.
          <br><br>

          Tax Already Paid: If you’ve already paid taxes through TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) or advance tax, subtract these amounts from your total tax liability.
          <br><br>

          Net Tax Payable: The remaining amount is your net tax payable.
        </p>
